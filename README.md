# NEFFIX NIGERIA CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION SALES PERFORMANCE 

## ABSTRACT
Abstract
**This project focuses on customer segmentation for a subscription-based service that offers three subscription types: Basic, Standard, and Premium. 
By segmenting customers based on their subscription choices, usage patterns, demographics, and other key behavioral factors,
this analysis aims to deliver actionable insights that can enhance customer engagement, retention, and profitability.**

## INTRODUCTION
**In today’s competitive digital economy, customer segmentation is a critical strategy for subscription-based businesses aiming to understand, engage, 
and retain their customers effectively. For services that offer tiered subscription models — typically Basic, Standard, and Premium — understanding
the unique characteristics and preferences of each subscriber type is crucial to optimizing marketing, personalizing user experience, and increasing long-term profitability.**

**This project focuses on developing a data-driven customer segmentation model for a subscription service that provides these three tiers. Customer
segmentation is particularly valuable in this context as it allows businesses to divide their diverse customer base into distinct groups based on
behavioral, demographic, and subscription-specific attributes. Through this process, companies can better understand patterns such as user engagement levels, 
upgrade/downgrade trends, churn risks, and factors influencing customer loyalty.**

**This project aims to provide insights that inform targeted marketing strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and maximize retention efforts.
Ultimately, customer segmentation enables the subscription service to align its offerings more closely with user needs, driving sustainable growth 
and building a more loyal customer base**

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
**As subscription-based services continue to grow, effectively managing and retaining a diverse customer base has become a significant challenge.
For a subscription service offering tiered plans — Basic, Standard, and Premium — understanding the unique characteristics, preferences, and 
behaviors of each customer segment is critical for driving engagement, reducing churn, and optimizing revenue. However, the lack of detailed
segmentation results in a one-size-fits-all approach that fails to address the varying needs of different customer groups, leading to suboptimal 
resource allocation and missed opportunities for personalized marketing and upselling.**
This project aims to address the following core issues:
•	**Identifying Distinct Customer Segments: What are the key characteristics that differentiate customers in each subscription tier (Basic, Standard, Premium),
and how do they vary in terms of demographics, usage patterns, and preferences?**
•	** Understanding Behavioral Drivers: What behavioral factors (e.g., frequency of use, average session duration, customer support interactions) influence a customer’s
likelihood to upgrade, downgrade, or churn? How do these factors vary across subscription tiers?**


•	**Predicting Subscription Tier Changes and Churn: Can we predict which customers are likely to switch tiers or discontinue their subscriptions?
What indicators can help identify at-risk customers within each segment?**

•	** Optimizing Marketing and Retention Strategies: How can the insights from customer segmentation be used to inform more targeted marketing 
strategies, personalized offers, and retention initiatives that cater to each customer group?**

•	**The goal of this analysis is to develop a comprehensive customer segmentation model that categorizes customers based on relevant factors
and provides actionable insights. By understanding and addressing the specific needs of each segment, the subscription service can enhance user experience,
increase retention, and maximize revenue, ultimately achieving a more sustainable and customer-centric growth strategy.**
